augment the trainig data with the mutated gene sequences, make note of the new acyl chain
Write script that takes Cs domain sequences, run alignment script for Cs with each reference 
Pull out corresponding positions (20 - 30 positions)
Run simple machine learning algorithms to pick out some pattern and find the length of the chain (range)
	- Use one hot encode on all of the regions picked out
	- SVM/Logistic Regression to do binary classification on non-standard vs. standard
	- Regression to create a prediction on the lipid tails
	- PCA on the regions to find clusters
